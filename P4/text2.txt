This routine takes two arguments. The first is of type pthread t, and
is used to specify which thread to wait for. This variable is initialized by
the thread creation routine (when you pass a pointer to it as an argument
to pthread create()); if you keep it around, you can use it to wait for
that thread to terminate.
The second argument is a pointer to the return value you expect to get
back. Because the routine can return anything, it is defined to return a
pointer to void; because the pthread join() routine changes the value
of the passed in argument, you need to pass in a pointer to that value, not
just the value itself.
Letâ€™s look at another example (Figure 27.2, page 4). In the code, a
single thread is again created, and passed a couple of arguments via the
myarg t structure. To return values, the myret t type is used. Once
the thread is finished running, the main thread, which has been waiting
inside of the pthread join() routine1
, then returns, and we can access
the values returned from the thread, namely whatever is in myret t.
